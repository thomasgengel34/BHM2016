We have been closed today after a VERY busy weekend! In addition to seeing many of you on tours, we also hosted a wedding reception on Saturday and a child's birthday party on Sunday! A member of one of our first families, Kara Pratte tied the knot with Britton Buehrig at the Guibourd-Valle House and celebrated with us at our Jean-Baptiste Valle House Gardens. The bride looked stunning and the groom dashing, and we were even able to capture a photo of Kara with her forefather, Jean-Baptiste Sebastien Pratte! From all of the staff and volunteers at the Bolduc House Museum, CONGRATULATIONS!!!
