            <strong>Come, Explore, Imagine and Discover …</strong>
            A different time and culture…a different Colonial American experience. Come explore
                                French colonial history as it was in this Missouri's first town. Colonial Ste. Genevieve
                                was a Community of Cultures - French, American Indian, and African - where life
                                depended on the Mississippi River, where empires clashed and combined, where producers
                                of grain, lead, salt, indigo, tobacco, and pork like our Louis Bolduc prospered
                                under the colonial regimes of both France and Spain until 1803 when Louisiana was
                                purchased for a mere $15,000,000 by the United States. Come, explore, imagine and
                                discover

                &quot;Bonjour! I am Zuts, the Squirrel and Mascot of the House Bolduc! I am building 
                                this website as fast as I can, so please be patient with it as it is still under 
                                construction! We are shifting between formats to confuse the CATS as we make the
                                site more friendly to new technology (even typewriters, I think)!!&quot;
