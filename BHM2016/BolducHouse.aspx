                <h2>Beginnings</h2>
                <p>
                    In 1792 French-speaking Monsieur Louis Bolduc joined the other residents of the
                    old town of Sainte Genevieve in the task of relocating the entire town inland about
                    three miles away from its original location on the Mississippi River just west of
                    Kaskaskia of the Illinois Country. This happened after the floods of 1785 inundated
                    the village’s houses up to the rafters yet again. Unable to salvage much of his
                    original house due to the damage from the flood water, as revealed by dendrochronology,
                    M. Bolduc may have salvaged  at least one board in the Bolduc House ceiling  
                    from the original house in the old town.
                </p>
                <h3>The House:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>A French-style vertical log house with a cedar shake hipped roof supported by a
                            hand-hewn Norman truss</li>
                    <li>Survived the 1811-1812 series of earthquakes along the New Madrid Fault</li>
                    <li>Owned by members of the Bolduc family from the late eighteenth century until 1948</li>
                    <li>Purchased, restored, furnished, and operated by The National Society of the Colonial
                            Dames of America in the State of Missouri</li>
                    <li>The restoration was supervised by <a href="VMEAConnally.aspx">Dr. Ernest A. Connally</a> of Washington University
                            in St. Louis who went on to write the National Historic Landmarks legislation for
                            the United States government</li>
                    <li>Furnished with authentic eighteenth century French Colonial artifacts and furniture
                            including some owned by Louis Bolduc, himself</li>
                    <li>The first National Historic Landmark in Sainte Genevieve, Missouri </li>
                    <li>Winner of the 2005 Preserve America Award</li>
                </ul>

                    <h3>A Mortar & Pestle:  An 18th Century Food Grinder</h3>

                    <h4>How did we get it?
                    </h4>
                    This mortar and pestle was purchased before the Bolduc House Museum opened in around 1957 
                                    <h4>What does it do?
                                    </h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>It pulverizes seeds and other dry ingredients 
                        </li>
                        <li>It pounds out medicinal powders 
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Did Madame Bolduc do her own cooking?
                    </h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The Bolducs had slaves including a female house slave named Agatha.
                                          So we think she did not do her own cooking.< 
                                           
                        </li>
                        <li>Who knows? We don’t even really know where the kitchen was before the one Marie
                                            Bolduc had built in 1815 
                        </li>
                        <li>We think that at first, they cooked in their bedroom because of something Henry
                                            M. Brackenridge wrote in his book about Ste. Genevieve 
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Why is there a controversy about where the kitchen was?
                    </h4>
                    <ul class="TfDdl">
                        <li>Dr. Connally, the architect who supervised the restoration built a replica kitchen
                                            based on his own research-based best guess. 
                        </li>
                        <li>The current kitchen was added by Marie Bolduc in 1815 after Louis Bolduc died. 
                        </li>
                        <li>The LeMeilleur House never included a kitchen when the family lived there.
