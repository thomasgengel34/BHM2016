                        Begin your visit at our Linden House which is located directly across Main
                    Street from the Bolduc House. Built in 1820, our shop, parlor, and center hall gallery
                    are in the original part of the house.

                        The Linden House contains our offices as well.  The kitchen is a center of activity for
                     all sorts of hands-on classes and the basement is used for growing young plants.

                        The gallery was the original porch which explains
                            why there are steps up to the other rooms. It contains a fabulous painting by Grant
                            Kniffen (See right). Dubbed “Making Salt”, this painting illustrates how Louis Bolduc and his
                            partners processed salt from the nearby Saline Creek in the late 18<sup>th</sup>
                        century. There is always something interesting in our exhibit case at the end of
                            the gallery. We change the exhibit about once every six weeks.

                            mementoes of our French colonial American site. For some reason we have quite a
                            few squirrel-themed items, as well, for sale in the shop – not for pecans, though,
                            no matter what Zuts tries to tell you.

            <h2>The Rozier Library &amp; Heritage Room</h2>
            <p>
                More than 400 rare books comprise the Rozier Library collection. They were donated to the Bolduc House Museum from
                            the Ste. Genevieve School District and we make them available to the community when
                            a curator is present with an appointment. Many of the books are in French. Some
                            were published in the 18<sup>th</sup> century. The subjects span Catholic devotional
                            books, early text books in French and English, and early Missouri law books. The
                            Colonial Dames also have a collection of books here. We are expanding our collection
                            to include genealogy resources and other items that local historians need. In addition
                            to the books in the library, upstairs is where our archives are stored – original
                            18<sup>th</sup> century documents, photographs of the restoration of the Bolduc
                            House and much more.

                The main museum office is in the Linden House across the Gallery Hallway from the Shop –
                         you can always interrupt whoever is in the office because here, you, the visitor, are the 
                        most person and priority of our day – Don’t tell Zuts the Squirrel, though. He thinks everything revolves around him.

                            staff break room. Of course, if you are holding a reception, wedding, or other event
                            in the Linden House Yard, you may borrow the kitchen and the adjoining service area
                            for your preparations.

                            Yard is probably 250 years old. We can fit a whole fourth grade class with their
                            teachers and parent chaperones inside the bushes and, from the outside, the group
                            cannot be seen at all!

                            Zuts would direct you to the pecan tree in the center of the yard. If it is fall,
