                <h2>Louis Bolduc: A Descendent of Royal Apothecaries</h2>
                <h4>Who were Pierre and Simon Bolduc?</h4>
                <p>
                    Louis Bolduc's ancestors 
                </p>
                <p>Frenchmen who lived in the 17th Century</p>

                <p>One discovered Epsom Salts </p>
                <p>
                    They were the apothecaries to Louis XIV and Louis XV, kings of France. Today we call them pharmacists.
                                            
                </p>
                <h4>What is an apothecary?</h4>
                <p>A chemist who makes & mixes medicines </p>
                <h4>How did the first Bolduc - also named Louis - get to North America?</h4>


                <p>He came with the Carolingian Regiment in a ship. </p>

                <h4>How did we get them?</h4>
                <p>They were purchased before the Bolduc House Museum opened in around 1957.</p>
                <p>
                    Old pewter cannot be exposed to temperatures below freezing or it may crack so we have to store in a place where the temperatures are stable. (Keeping our pewter 
                        collection on display year round is one reason we would like to fund a heating and cooling system in the Bolduc House.

                <p>This is a hand colored original print of the Battle of Quebec. It was first produced and published in the 1760 edition of The "London"  Magazine.  It was purchased in 1957 before the restored Louis Bolduc House was opened to the public.</p>
                <p>It needs some special attention.    The print is not archivally framed so it is vulnerable to deterioration caused by                                         fluctuations in temperature, humidity, and light. It will cost around $350 to address the preservation needs of this wonderful print.</p>

                <p>The English and the French are fighting here.  The English won the battle.</p>
                <p>Here we meet some of the major players for the American Revolution in the French & Indian War - research George Washington, for starters.</p>
                <p>As a result of this battle in the Seven Years War (as it is known in Europe  (known as the French & Indian War in North America),  Spain got the French territory west of the Mississippi River and New Orleans.   Spain got Ste. Genevieve- it was a hush-hush preemptive treaty between the two Bourbon ruled countries to prevent those heretic Protestant Englishmen from getting any more French territory than was absolutely necessary. This is how England got Canada and Illinois which it attached to Virginia. England also got India - which France lost. </p>
                <p>The Indians were promised (by England) that they would be able to live forever in the North West Territories i.e. Ohio and Indiana - oh well, that didn't last long at all.</p>

                <p>We do not know if Louis Bolduc was wounded.</p>
                <p>His house was burned down - we even have a shingle from one of the burned down Bolduc houses - his uncle's, we think - in a frame in our Bolduc House.  </p>
                <p>He did decide to leave Quebec with his wife, Marguerite and their baby son, Louis.</p>
                <p>We know he died in 1815 and is buried in the Memorial Cemetery in Ste. Genevieve.</p>
                <p>Since he is descended from educated men, certainly Louis Bolduc was educated as well– explore what we do and don’t know about him and his family.</p>

                    <h4>How did we get this map?</h4>
                    <p>It was purchased based on the information in the inventory of Louis Bolduc’s property after the death of his second wife, Agatha Govreau. The National Society of the Colonial Dames of America in the State of Missouri funded its acquisition in 1957 </p>

                    <h4>Does it need any special care or restoration?</h4>
                    <ul class="TfDdl">
                        <li>It was archivally framed several years ago</li>
                        <li>There is some damage from where our interpreters used a pointer to locate Ste. Genevieve

                        <li>It is difficult for visitors to read easily because the Bolduc House Museum has

                    <ul class="TfDdl">
                        <li>It was drawn by D’Anville, the most prolific cartographer of Louis XV. He never
                                            left Paris so to draw the map D;Anville required really good technical communication
                                            skills from the explorers.</li>

                        <li>The longitude notation uses a prime meridian different from Greenwich, England. 
                        </li>
                        <li>It shows Ste. Genevieve, Kaskaskia, and Cahokia but not St. Louis. </li>
                        <li>It is centered on Washington. D.C.  </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>What inaccuracies are there on this map?</h4>
                    <ul class="TfDdl">
                        <li>Lake Michigan should not be due north of the Florida peninsula. 
                        </li>
                        <li>Lake Michigan is too little. </li>
