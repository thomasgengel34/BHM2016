                                The ancestors of five federally recognized Native-American groups: <a href="http://www.shawnee-tribe.com/">the Shawnee Tribe</a>, <a href="http://delawarenation.com/">The Delaware Nation</a>, <a href="http://www.delawaretribe.org/home.htm">The Delaware Tribe</a>, <a href="http://www.astribe.com/">the Absentee Shawnee Tribe</a>, and <a href="http://www.estoo-nsn.gov/">
                                    the Eastern Shawnee Tribe of Oklahoma</a> lived in eastern Missouri between 1780 and 1830.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Not native to this region, these Eastern Woodland Tribes had been pushed increasingly
                                farther west of their ancestral lands by the encroaching British and American settlers.
                                After the French and Indian War, the tribes settled in the Northwest Territories,
                                today’s Ohio and Indiana. However, the treaties which permitted this were not kept
                                by the Americans which provoked the Indian Wars fought against Gen. Anthony Wayne.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The most famous Shawnee chief, Tecumseh, attempted to form a pan-tribal alliance
                                of Indians from tribes living all along the Ohio and Mississippi River Valleys.
                                He and his brother, “the Prophet”, advocated a return to traditional Indian ways.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Some members of his Shawnee tribe and their close allies, the Leni-Lenape (Delaware)
                                tribe, did not subscribe to his opinions. These factions moved to the west side
                                of the Mississippi River where they lived under the protection, invitation, and
                                ultimately a land grant from the Spanish king in a series of villages between St.
                                Louis and Cape Girardeau.

                            <h3>The Stone Cottage</h3>
                            <p>The stone cottage is located west of (behind) the Bolduc house. </p>
                            <p>
                                The stone cottage was built in 1958 by Dr. Ernest A. Connally
                                who supervised the restoration of the Louis Bolduc House. He surmised that there
                                may have been an outdoor kitchen in a similar building just west of the Bolduc House.
                            </p>
                            <p>It now is home to our exhibits on native Americans.</p>
                            <p> This picture was taken before the construction of the bread oven. The triangular structure that can be seen here in front of it is the well. </p>

                    <h3>The Doctrine of Discovery</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Doctrine of Discovery is the international law based on a set of papal bulls
                        which gave the European Catholic and, later, Protestant monarchs the moral authority
                        to take land and enslave peoples in Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It was used
                        as late as 1970 by our country’s courts to adjudicate issues relating to Native
                        American tribes. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/BolducHouse?feature=mhee#p/c/CB1BF62192F143E8/0/drLnI_k5b6s">
                            An attempt is being made by the Anglican Church worldwide to get the doctrine overturned.
                        </a>
                    </p>
                    <p>Several other church bodies have renounced it. </p>
                    <p>The Catholic Church is considering formally revoking it. There is consideration in that Church that technically this is unnecessary as:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The bull <em>Sublimis Deo</em> issued by Pope Paul III in 1537 declared the American Indians to be children of God, worthy of salvation, and forbade enslaving them.</li>
                        <li>There is language in the Catholic Catechism making it clear that the Doctrine of Discovery is not to be enforced.</li>
                        <li>By various statements Pope Francis has made it clear that the concepts embodied in the Doctrine of Discovery are null and void.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>However, it has not been specifically revoked.</p>

                        The exhibit in our stone cottage provides visitors with information about these
                        tribes during the time they lived in this area. Native American flute music is playing
                        in the background. While here you can watch a series of short videos to see how
                        these tribes lived, made their canoes, dwellings, pottery, etc. You can also see
                        videos of the tribal members today
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The exhibit includes 18th century Indian artifacts from the region as well as replica
                        pottery made by our own Liz Manns, a Chippewa belt, and a painted Western Sioux
                        pouch.

                        These baskets were donated to the exhibit by the Eastern Shawnee Tribe of Oklahoma.
                        They sit on top of a buffalo robe along with an 18th century corn masher. The photograph
                        above this display is what the Apple Creek area looks like. A hand-drawn 1969 map
                        of Appleton, Missouri, places the original site of Chillicothe near the southwest
                        edge of town. Chillicothe is a Shawnee word which means “big village.”

                    <p>
                        We are also creating a child-sized Eastern Woodlands Indian Village outside. In
                        2011 we installed a pit kiln where our Native American ceramics class fires their
                        pieces. We also started a Three Sister’s Garden. In 2012 we added other components.

                        <p>
                            STE. GENEVIEVE -- On Wednesday Chief Glenna Wallace of the Eastern Shawnee Tribe of Oklahoma ( <a target="_blank" href="http://www.estoo-nsn.gov/government/chief/">http://www.estoo-nsn.gov/government/chief/ </a> ) will receive a 2013 Missouri Humanities Award for Exemplary Community Achievement at a ceremony in Jefferson City. Chief Glenna provided significant assistance, encouragement, and functioned as a liaison between the Missouri Society of the Colonial Dames, three Shawnee tribes, two Delaware tribes, and the Missouri Humanities Council in the creation of the exhibit: This Community of Cultures – the Shawnee and Delaware Indian Experience in Eastern Missouri.
                        </p><p>
                            The colonial Spanish government recruited members of these tribes to settle on the west side of the Mississippi River in a series of villages between St. Louis and Cape Girardeau beginning in around 1785. The idea was for the tribes to assist in the defense of the river from the encroaching Americans to the east and from the Osage Indians to the west. Spain even provided the tribes with a land grant near Apple Creek in Perry County.
                        </p><p>
                            Not only did the Shawnee tribe have a reputation for being the "best hunters, farmers, and warriors" they regarded the Delaware tribe as the "grandfathers." Louis Lorimier, the founder of Cape Girardeau was married to a Shawnee woman and Tecumseh’s relative married a Frenchman, Monsieur Maisonville, in New Madrid.
                        </p><p>
                            These are just two examples of the multi-ethnic, multi-cultural community that was New France here in the mid-Mississippi valley. However, even with European title to the land, these tribes were evicted by the Americans to Indian Territory following the 1830 Indian Resettlement act.
                        </p><p>
                            As the Bolduc House Museum transitions to tell a larger story of New France in the mid-Mississippi valley in the Spanish Illinois Country of Upper Louisiana, our intent is to interpret the multi-ethnic, multi-cultural community whose members called our first town in Missouri home prior to the Louisiana Purchase. Chief Glenna Wallace continues to provide us with insight and information about her tribe.
                        </p><p>
                            In addition to the exhibit in the stone cottage behind our National Historic Landmark Louis Bolduc House, which contains artifacts and information about the tribes’ history here as well as its modern presence in western Missouri and eastern Oklahoma, we are developing an outdoor "living history" Eastern Woodland Indian village.
                        </p><p>
                            So far we have a maple tree for sugaring, a ceramics firing pit, a traditional Three Sister’s garden and a dye garden. We just installed a frame for a wigwam and over the next several months we will be weaving and installing mats to provide the outer siding for the wigwam.
                        </p><p>
                            Our nomination for Chief Glenna Wallace to receive a 2013 Missouri Humanities Award for Exemplary Community Achievement was supported by a letter from the mayor of Ste. Genevieve. The National Society of the Colonial Dames of America in the State of Missouri, the tax-exempt 501(c)(3) organization which owns and operates the Bolduc House Museum appreciates and celebrates Chief Glenna Wallace for her generous involvement with our historic site.
