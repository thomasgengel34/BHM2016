                <h4>How did we get the pewter?</h4>
                <p>They were purchased before the Bolduc House Museum opened in around 1957.</p>
                <p>
                    Old pewter cannot be exposed to temperatures below freezing or it may crack so we have to store in a place where the temperatures are stable. (Keeping our pewter
                    collection on display year round is one reason we would like to fund a heating and cooling system in the Bolduc House.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since Louis Bolduc  is descended from educated men, certainly he was educated as
                    well– explore what we do and don’t know about him and his family.

                <p>This is a hand colored original print of the Battle of Quebec. It was first produced and published in the 1760 edition of The "London"  Magazine.  It was purchased in 1957 before the restored Louis Bolduc House was opened to the public.</p>
                <p>It needs some special attention.    The print is not archivally framed so it is vulnerable to deterioration caused by fluctuations in temperature, humidity, and light. It will cost around $350 to address the preservation needs of this wonderful print.</p>

                <p>The English and the French are fighting here.  The English won the battle.</p>
                <p>Here we meet some of the major players for the American Revolution in the French & Indian War - research George Washington, for starters.</p>
                <p>As a result of this battle in the Seven Years War (as it is known in Europe  (known as the French & Indian War in North America),  Spain got the French territory west of the Mississippi River and New Orleans.   Spain got Ste. Genevieve- it was a hush-hush preemptive treaty between the two Bourbon ruled countries to prevent those heretic Protestant Englishmen from getting any more French territory than was absolutely necessary. This is how England got Canada and Illinois which it attached to Virginia. England also got India - which France lost. </p>
                <p>The Indians were promised (by England) that they would be able to live forever in the North West Territories i.e. Ohio and Indiana - oh well, that didn't last long at all.</p>

                <p>We do not know if Louis Bolduc was wounded.</p>
                <p>His house was burned down - we even have a shingle from one of the burned down Bolduc houses - his uncle's, we think - in a frame in our Bolduc House.  </p>
                <p>He did decide to leave Quebec with his wife, Marguerite and their baby son, Louis.</p>
                <p>We know he died in 1815 and is buried in the Memorial Cemetery in Ste. Genevieve.</p>
                <p>Since he is descended from educated men, certainly Louis Bolduc was educated as well– explore what we do and don’t know about him and his family.</p>

                            Find Chicago where Louis’ wife, Marguerite and his baby son, Louis both died (Oh, wait, it’s just a stinking field of onions in 1755)

                <p>Whoops! It looks like SOME CAT got in here and maybe mixed up some of these SENTENCES and some of them go with the WRONG MAP!! Can you figure out which ones are wrong? Where is that CAT? - Zuts</p>
                <p>Ah, oui. The Second MAP is the map made by D'Anville in 1755. It shows the route that Louis Bolduc used to get to Ste. Genevieve. I KNOW my HISTORY.  Ask the tour guides about the rest. I am BUSY.  - Zuts</p>
