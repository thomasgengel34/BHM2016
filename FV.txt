This is the Francois Valle House, built 1792 or earlier. It is a vertical log house on a stacked stone foundation. It belonged to the first commandant in the "new town" who was the brother of the last commandant. Our goal is to do a historic structures report and archaeology prior to restoring the house to its original configuration and using in perhaps to interpret the military and civil government in colonial Ste. Genevieve.
