                <article>
                    <p>
                        Eighteenth century French Colonial American homes such as the Louis Bolduc House
                        were surrounded by a wooden palisade fence to keep the roaming animals out. The
                        fence enclosed the gardens as well. Usually these gardens were filled with the vegetables,
                        kitchen and medicinal herbs, as well as the plants that were needed for other tasks.
                        A small orchard and vineyard could also be found within the stockade. When you visit
                        the Bolduc House Museum, don&#39;t miss our carefully articulated gardens behind
                        the palisade. You will also be able to drive passed the fertile flood plain where
                        the French grew such staples as wheat, tobacco, and indigo. The land-owners cooperated
                        in farming the Grand Champ (or Big Field). Each land-owner was assigned their own
                        narrow strips, called arpents, in the Grand Champ. They were also responsible to
                        build and maintain the fence along their arpents. The Grand Champ is just east of
                        St. Mary’s Road which is an extension of Main Street south of the Bolduc House Museum.

                        The LeMeilleur House gardens are four large perennial beds with showy colorful blooms
                        from March through October. They are planted as tribute gardens to honor the Museum&#39;s
                        first two directors, Lorraine Stange who succeeded her mother, Vergie Stange. These
                        directors kept the &quot;never-ending Bolduc House story&quot; alive from 1961-2009.
                        This yard also contains several fruit trees: pecan, apples, and chestnut.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Behind the LeMeilleur House is where we are building our Eastern Woodland Indian
                        Village. There you will find a traditional Three Sisters Garden in which corn, beans,
                        and squashes grow in a symbiotic relationship. Ask us to tell you the story of the
                        three sisters when you visit.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Linden House garden has a very large lawn where people can hold a wedding or
                        larger garden party. The Linden House was named for a very large linden tree which
                        died a few years ago. Now we have a baby linden tree growing to replace it. This
                        yard also contains the Lewis &amp; Clark Garden and a large stand of Ste. Genevieve
                        Boxwoods with its secret hiding place that is large enough for an entire fourth
                        grade class.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If our master gardener, Patti Naeger, is around when you come she&#39;ll be happy
                        to give you a hands-on tour of the gardens - you might get to dig a few potatoes,
                        pick some beans or pumpkins, or sample some grapes.
                    </p>

                                with authentic and inspiring architecture. Everything was better than we could have
                                ever wished. There was plenty of space for all of our 60+ guest (even when the rain
                                started). The gardens and landscape are beautiful and make a gorgeous back drop
                                for photographs! The staff was more than accommodating and were able to handle the
                                transition from outdoors to indoors (due to weather) with ease. A great place for
                                a reception and outdoor ceremony”<br />

                                        This delicious cardoon is just one sample of the wonderfully yummy plants that Patti grows in MY Bolduc House’s 18th century French kitchen garden. A cardoon tastes a lot like an artichoke and like that plant, is in the THISTLE family. If you are a squirrel who is familiar with bird feeders, thistle seeds are the most delicate of all but they usually are found in the long feeders with the tiniest of openings.

                                <p>In fact our 18th century French kitchen gardens are remarkably easy to access. They are just across the channel fence from MY Louis Bolduc House. So, if you hop from the cedar shake roof to the top of the stockade fence, just scurry west until you cross the entire fire break (in the late Fall you can often find wind-blown pecans from the neighbor’s tree in the firebreak – just saying…. Otherwise there is nothing good to eat there.)</p>
                                <p>These poppies are beautiful but they can lead to some very curious dreams if you bite them. Now if Bijou or one of the other cats managed to bite or scratch you badly, the poppy juice can help dull the pain. In the same bed there are STRAWBERRIES! ….and herbs and some other flowers and usually in the early spring Pattie plants PEAS! If you are a human cook, you may like this recipe for pea soup which is similar to one my great grandsire, ‘Tit Monsieur wrote about in his journal.</p>

                                <p>Now these purple grapes are GOOD. Agatha Bolduc, the girl who adopted my great grand-sire, ‘Tit Monsieur, married a man (Rene LeMeilleur) who like her grandfather, Louis, imported wine from France because no one knew how to get the right kinds of grapes to grow here in North America.</p>
                                <p>It wasn’t until the late nineteenth century that a human botanist tried grafting a European wine producing grape vine onto a wild American one. </p>
                                <p>Another of my relatives, Scamp, added information to the journal when MY Bolduc House was being restored by  Dr. Ernest Connally.   Scamp reported that the shoots of the newly planted grape vines were amazingly tasty. They were a gift for the opening day of MY Bolduc House in 1958 from a sister <a href="http://www.nscda.org">Colonial Dame site in Virginia</a> and are called Old World Grapes. In 2012 some people used the grape arbor as their aisle in their wedding.</p>

On this side there is a big pecan tree, some very old rose bushes that produce sweet petals and delicious rose hips – BEWARE of the THORNS! If they get into one of your paws you will have a great deal of difficulty escaping that hungry cat, Bijou!

I do know they are very edible - better than more modern ones! If you want to hear about heirloom plants you can come to the Linden House on Monday, February 13, 2012 from 7PM-8:30. She is doing a program called “For the Love of Heirlooms.” Patti grew more than 30 different kinds of heirloom tomatoes in 2011. She will post the list of which kinds of plants she is growing in time for you other human gardeners to plan to buy some from MY Museum Shop.</p>

She had the bad manners to crawl up inside the walls and now LaDonna, the curator who is in league with the vicious CATS of Ste. Genevieve (check my FACEBOOK page for INFORMATION) is setting TRAPS all over the Linden House. Quite a few of my smaller mouse friends could not resist the warnings about the peanut butter on the floor. Now they are lost forever. I am mourning.

Patti wrote their names on garden stakes shaped like fleur de lis which she put next to each plant. She put the English names and the French names on the stakes. I should probably write on the labels whether they taste good or not to us squirrels.</p>

                                    I even got to help plant this newest garden in the Eastern Woodland Indian Village which is located just west of the LeMeilleur yard. This garden is the one Patti pays the least attention too and in which there are the best things to EAT. It is a Three Sisters’ Garden with 3 different kinds of plants. The tallest is CORN!!!!!!!! And, Patti leaves it to DRY on the stalks which gives us squirrels LOTS of time to nibble and take some back to our dreys for the winter days when pecans get boring. Green beans wind around the corn stalks – they are good to eat too and the more you eat, the more new beans grow. At the bottom there are squash vines. I do not like the way squash tastes but the big leaves provide plenty of shade on hot summer days and the squash blossoms are very delicious.

                                <p>There is a large grassy yard where the humans play croquet and sometimes the kids who visit have duels with swords and water balloons. This makes it difficult for us squirrels to get the apples, pecans, and chestnuts that grow in the same area. Have you ever been hit by a rolling croquet ball?  I almost got hit years ago because I did not understand the game. </p>
                                <p>Now I stay in the highest branches of the wine sap apple tree whenever I see humans playing croquet.</p>

                                    When fourth graders visit MY Bolduc House because they are studying Missouri history they get to go inside this boxwood grove. The whole class can fit inside so well that nobody can see them from the outside. But they can usually hear them.

                                We squirrels and lots of our bird friends like to cool off in here on hot summer days. We have to be careful because sometimes the CATS come in here hunting. I HATE CATS – especially that Bijou.</p>
